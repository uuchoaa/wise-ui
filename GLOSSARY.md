# Glossary

Project-level terms used across this repo.

## Project

- **wise-ui** — this project. A Vue 3 design system built on top of the
  Tailwind Plus Application UI bundle.

## Consumers

- **Cashflow** — reference app, stacked shell, invoicing/finance domain.
  One of the two apps wise-ui must cover. See
  `docs/assets/application-ui-v4/GLOSSARY.md` for the screen map.
- **Planetaria** — reference app, sidebar shell, deployments/DevOps
  domain. The other app wise-ui must cover. Same glossary for details.
- **Garage Sale** — future personal app (moving-sale tool, single-user,
  pt-BR). Will consume wise-ui later. Not in this repo's scope.

## Directories

- **`src/`** — wise-ui itself (Vue components, tokens, primitives).
- **`examples/cashflow/`, `examples/planetaria/`** — working
  implementations of the reference apps, built with wise-ui. Currently
  WIP scaffolds.
- **`docs/assets/application-ui-v4/`** — Tailwind Plus reference pattern
  library. Read-only; browsed and cherry-picked from, never edited.
- **`docs/articles/`** — long-form notes on decisions taken during the
  project.
